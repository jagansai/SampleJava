 * In Version 1, we asked the user to enter the numbers 1 after the other.
 * It worked fine, but it was not quite natural. User was asked to enter few choices and then there was a reply.
 * Instead, how about asking the user to make the calculations in  an expression format?
 *
 * For e.g. User enters like 👇🏻
 *
 *  > 1 + 2 ( Enter )
 *  > 3
 *  > 2 - 1 ( Enter )
 *  > 1
